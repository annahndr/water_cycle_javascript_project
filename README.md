# water_cycle_javascript_project

## About this project
This was a fun 5-day pair-programmed project (with @lmeromy) to create an educational app for children to learn about the water cycle. We wanted the user to be able to interact with the page to view some content and to practise making a full-stack app using a mongoDB and webpack.

## To run this app locally
Clone the repo and in your command line, navigate to the project folder, then:
1. 'npm install'
2. run the seeds file: 'mongo < server/db.seeds.js'
3. then: 'npm run server:dev'
4. while that's running, in a new terminal window: 'npm run build'
5. while that's running, in a new terminal window: 'mongod'
6. open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000/ to view the app
